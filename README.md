# crackmes

Open and censorship resistant crackmes repository

## What's this?

[crackmes.de](http://crackmes.de) is down, and there's no stable alternative with a well organized, up-to-date and timeproof collection of crackmes.
We try to solve this problem, using a git repository to organize the crackmes, the github issue tracker and pull requests to allow users to upload new crackmes or write reviews, and [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) for persistent storage.

## How to upload a new crackme

Execute *crackme_uploader.py* which will create a IPFS hash. With that hash you can create a new crackme and send a PR. 
Of course you will need to have ipfs installed and you should try to keep your daemon open so our dedicated server can download it an pin it.

## How to download a crackme

For now *download.py* script will download all the crackmes.

## How to write a review

TODO

## Help wanted

There's a lot to do:

* Send crackmes: The whole point of this project is to help people (including us) to improve with their reverse engineering skills, so we need new crackmes.
* Share crackmes using IPFS: We will be sharing all the crackmes, but one of our main goals is to not depend on a central point of failure.
* We're not native english speakers, so any help with writing or fixing language related problems will be appreciated.
* If you have any other idea just share it with us, draw a logo, or just spread the word.
